# Elevator Goes Up?
This [game](https://ageneric.itch.io/elevator-goes-up) was originally made in 72 hours
for the [Ludum Dare 48](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/) jam event. The
original build may be found on the `original-jam-version` branch.

It has been updated since the jam event, most recently in 2023, and currently features
multiple screens of mechanics and content, saving, and an ending.

The code is not optimised or ideal, as many structural decisions were made in
72 hours. Please don't take this as an example!

Made using Unity with WebGL for the web build.
